By the maekawa's algorithm, each process need have their own voting set. To access, process need to send request to every vting sets member, 
it need to get all granted from voting sets member. The quorum of maekawa need to satisify 4 condition:

Each process belongs to its own voting set
Intersection of any two voting sets is non-empty
Each voting set is of size K
Each process belongs to M voting sets

because there is only one process can be granted by all the voting set, so if the multiple processes wish to enter the CS at the same time, 
they may locked their own voting set member and wait for other voting set to grant them. And it will cause the deadlock, every process lock 
their voting and wait for others.
